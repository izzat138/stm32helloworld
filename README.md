# stm32helloworld
This repository documents the details of the UART project on STM32F103C8T6 MCU together with the STM32CubeIDE, an open-source C/C++ development platform for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors.

We are required to program an STM32 MCU using open-source STM32CubeIDE in C language to print the "Hello World" message and the value of the 4-bit DIP switch on the terminal once the switch value is changed. A C code is included in this repository for reference.

stm32helloworld contains the project that uses pins GPIOB-PIN12, GPIOB-PIN13, GPIOB-PIN14 and GPIOB-PIN15 to read DIP switch input and GPIOA-PIN9 and GPIOA-PIN10 as UART interface. Also, this project uses GPIOD-PIN0 and GPIOD-PIN1 for the RCC controller.

12. Connect the STM32 MCU through the USB port with the ST-LINK V2. Then, connect with the MCU in the utility and start to program it.

Note: Move the BOOT jumper to the right to enable the microcontroller to go into programming mode.

13. Use the CH340 USB to TTL Converter to connect the STM32 MCU through the USB port.

Note: Move the BOOT jumper to the left to enable the microcontroller to go into normal mode.

# Reflections

This STM32 project creation facilitates us in understanding the UART interface, especially on how to implement it on the STM32. The UART interface transmits data asynchronously and does not use a clock signal to synchronize the transmitter and receiver devices. As a result, the UART interface does not require the clock pin and only 2 pins are required for the transmitter and receiver. This project requires us to use the external UART module in which we are using CH340 USB to TTL Converter since the STM32 board does not have an onboard converter.
